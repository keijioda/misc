CH sample size for egg grant
================

## Research design

-   Two-arm parallel design between a control diet and an intervention
    diet for 12 weeks
-   Two outcomes: diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and HDL cholesterol
    -   Will be measured at the baseline and at week 12
    -   Compare changes from baseline between the two groups

## Assumptions

-   Two-tailed tests with *α* = 0.05
-   For the sake of simplicity, we assumed:
    -   Outcome measures are normally distributed
    -   Equal variances between the baseline and the post-intervention
    -   Equal variances between the control and the intervention groups

## Common parameters

-   Type I error of *α* = 0.05 and power of 80%
-   A correlation between the baseline and the post-intervention (at
    week 12) was assumed to be *ρ* = 0.4 or 0.5

## Sample size for DBP

-   For DBP, we assumed:
    -   A difference in mean change of 0.6, 0.8, or 1.0 mmHg between the
        two groups
    -   A common standard deviation of 1.0 or 1.2 mmHg
-   For a difference in mean change of 0.8 mmHg with SD = 1.2 and *ρ* =
    0.5, *n* = 37 subjects will be needed per group in order to achieve
    80% of power with *α* = 0.05.

|   1.0 | 1.2 |  0.5 |      1.20 |  24 |

## Sample size for HDL

-   For HDL, we assumed:

    -   A difference in mean change of 0.025, 0.075, or 0.1 mmol/L
        between the two groups
    -   A common standard deviation of 0.05 or 0.2 mmol/L

-   For a difference in mean change of 0.025 mmol/L with SD = 0.05 and
    *ρ* = 0.5, *n* = 64 subjects will be needed per group in order to
    achieve 80% of power with *α* = 0.05.

-   For a difference in mean change of 0.1 mmol/L with SD = 0.2 and *ρ*
    = 0.5, *n* = 64 subjects will be needed per group in order to
    achieve 80% of power with *α* = 0.05.
