IN sample size for GRASP
================

## Research design

-   Cross-over design, 2x2 (AB/BA)
-   Primary outcome: Weight loss (kg)

## Assumptions

-   Two-tailed tests with *α* = 0.05
-   For the sake of simplicity, we assumed:
    -   Outcome measures are normally distributed
    -   Equal variances between the control and the intervention groups
-   Assume 10% dropout rate

## Common parameters

-   Type I error of *α* = 0.05 and power of 80%
-   A correlation of measurements between the two treatments was assumed
    to be *ρ* = 0.4 or 0.5

## Sample size for weight loss

-   For weight loss as the primary outcome, we assumed:
    -   A difference in mean weight loss (`delta`) of 1, 2, or 4 kg
        between the two groups
    -   The standard deviation of weight equals to 2 or 4 kg
-   The table below shows:
    -   The total sample size necessary at the end of the study
        (`n_total`)
    -   The sample size at the beginning of the study accounting for 10%
        dropouts (`drop10`).
