# EH BESO additional analysis

## Inflamamatory/oxidative markers by sex
- Previously, in order to examine if the treatment effect exists, for each outcome we ran a mixed model that include:
  - Treatment (soy/placebo), time (pre/post), interactions between treatment x time, sequence, phase, and wave as fixed-effects terms
  - Subjects as a random-effects term

- To examine if the effect of treatment is different between genders, we further added gender and the 3-way interaction of treatment x time x gender. If the 3-way interaction is significant, this would suggest that the treatment effect is different between genders and we will need to procced to stratified analysis by gender.

- Among all the inflammatory/oxidative markers (hsCRP, IL-1, IL-1ra, IL-6, TNF-a, haptoglobin, TAS, TBARS), the 3-way interaction was found to be significant only on TNF-a (*p* = 0.0182) and TAS (*p* = 0.0322).
